# ðŸ§µ Operating Systems Project 2  
## Thread-Based Process Simulation and Synchronization  
**Course:** Operating Systems 4320â€“6320  
**Semester:** Spring 2025  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
In this project, you will simulate real-time process execution using threads and learn how operating systems handle synchronization. You will implement one classic synchronization problem using mutexes or semaphores.

## ðŸ§ª Step-by-Step Instructions  

### 1. Simulate Processes with Threads  
- Reuse or modify your `processes.txt` file from Project 1.  
- Each process becomes a thread.  
- Simulate the CPU burst using `sleep()` or `Thread.sleep()`.

**Java Example:**  
<pre>
class ProcessThread extends Thread {
    int pid, burstTime;

    public ProcessThread(int pid, int burstTime) {
        this.pid = pid;
        this.burstTime = burstTime;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Process " + pid + " started.");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(burstTime * 1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        System.out.println("Process " + pid + " finished.");
    }
}
</pre>

### 2. Add Synchronization with Locks or Semaphores  
Choose one of the following classic synchronization problems and solve it using synchronization primitives:

#### 2.1. Dining Philosophers  
- Five threads represent philosophers.  
- Each philosopher thinks, picks up two forks (locks), eats, and releases the forks.  
- Use strategies to avoid deadlocks (e.g., pick up the lower-numbered fork first).  

#### 2.2. Readers-Writers  
- Multiple readers can read simultaneously.  
- Writers need exclusive access.  
- Use mutexes and reader counters to manage access.  

#### 2.3. Producer-Consumer  
- A producer thread adds items to a buffer.  
- Consumer threads remove items.  
- Use a bounded buffer, mutex, and semaphores to control access.  

### 3. Show Thread Activity  
- Print when each thread starts, waits for a lock, acquires it, and finishes.

**Example Output:**  
<pre>
[Philosopher 2] Waiting for forks...
[Philosopher 2] Picked up fork 1 and 2
[Philosopher 2] Eating...
[Philosopher 2] Released forks
</pre>
